# MarsBaseOne
This project is a solution to the NASAÂ´s Space Apps Challange: https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/survivor-mars-lava-tubes/

An educational game that aims to get the player into using NASA's Orbiter images of Mars to identify lava tubes and then use strategy to create a viable colony through the efficient use of local resources and sporadic incomes from Earth.
